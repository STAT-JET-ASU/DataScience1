     * If you need help signing up for your account, see Dr. Thomley during office hours.

```{block, week01note, type='rmdnote'}
* Take notes as you work though the DataCamp modules. The goal is to learn, not just finish!
* A great way to get familiar with the RStudio server is to use it to take notes and create examples.
* RStudio has helpful [Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)! You may want to start with _Base R_ and _R Markdown_ cheat sheets.
* R scripts can contain only code and comments. R Markdown files can contain customizable text and code.
```

```{block, week01optional, type='rmdoptional'}
Optionally, you may wish to install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and  [$LaTeX$](http://www.ctan.org/starter) on your personal computer.
