Please use something similar to __FirstnameLastname__ as your username when you register; you will want to appear professional. For example, my username on GitHub is __jillthomley__. If you have a popular name such as John Smith, you willl probably need to add some other distinguishing character to your username.
     * If you need help signing up for your account, see Dr. Thomley during office hours.

```{block, week01note, type='rmdnote'}

* RStudio has helpful [Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)! Start with _Base R_ and _R Markdown_ cheat sheets.
* A great way to get familiar with the RStudio server is to use it to take notes.
* R Markdown files can contain customizable text and code.
* R scripts can contain only code and comments. 
```

```{block, week01optional, type='rmdoptional'}
