### Course Overview

Class time in this course will be a mix of lecture and hands-on activities. Data science 1 is an introductory course with no statistics or programming prerequisites. Students come into the course with a broad mix of skills. This means that the most effective mode of instruction tends to be a semi-flipped classroom approach where some primary instruction occurs outside class, in this case largely in the form of Datacamp assignments. Students can work on DataCamp modules at their own pace in an iterative fashion. This frees up class time to spend on work where students can give and receive help from peers and the instructor. Do not treat this instructional mode as an invitation to skip class! Your classmates are one of your greatest resources.

**Abbreviations**

DC = _DataCamp_  
MD = _Modern Dive_  
RDS = _R for Data Science_  
HW = homework
