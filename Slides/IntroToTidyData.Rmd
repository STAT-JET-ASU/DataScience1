## Before We Begin...

These slides assume that you have completed the DataCamp course [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

It would also be helpful to read beforehand Chapters 2 and 4 of the digital text [*Modern Dive*](https://moderndive.com/).

These slides are not meant to be standalone information, but rather a guide for hands-on lecture. Be prepared to take notes to flesh out the contents. 

I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can include information and code from the slides as well as your own additional notes and explorations.

These slides were produced using R Markdown. See "[4.1 ioslides presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html)" in [*R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).


## Dataset Structure

* A variable is some underlying attribute of interest that can differ between individuals being measured.

* An observational unit (or observation) is a single individual, object, or entity about which we have collected data for one or underlying attributes (variables).

* An observation may be called a case, subject, or participant.

* Ideally, each observational unit has a value for each variable.

A dataset is a collection of data values for the observations and variables in a study (e.g., survey or experiment). A common way to arrange data is to put variables in columns and observations in rows. This is what we call `tidy` data. 


## `tidy` Data

* Each column is a variable (one unique underlying attribute)
* Each row is an observation (one object that was measured)
* Each type of observational unit forms a "table"
* Untidy data is sometimes called `wide` (versus `long`) format


## Types of Variables

* categorical / qualitative
    + nominal
    + ordinal

* numerical / quantitative
    + interval
    + ratio

Numerical variables are also classified as discrete or continuous.

Ranks are technically ordinal data, but sometimes we treat them as if they are numbers (e.g., reporting average rank).

How might these correspond to different classes of vectors in R?


## Reading Data into R

Many file types can be read into R. We will start with `.csv` files read from the web (see [class data files](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/DatasetList.html) page for  links to several different datasets).

The `read.csv()` function converts a `.csv` file into a data frame. The `read_csv()` function in the `readr` package coverts a `.csv` file into an enhanced data frame known as a `tibble`.

`draft <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft.csv"))`

`draft_wide <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft_wide.csv"))`

```{r include=FALSE}
library(readr)
draft <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft.csv"))
draft_wide <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft_wide.csv"))
```


## Data Frame vs. Tibble

A data frame is a two dimensional structure or array in R. It is a special case of a list where each component (column) has equal length. Each column can contain a different variable type.

A tibble is a somewhat tweaked version of a data frame found in the `tidyverse`. For more, see [Tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) in _R for Data Science_.

Before doing any kind of visualization or analyses, you need to explore your dataset and become familiar with its structure and contents. We will be using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. These and other tools are collected in `tidyverse`.

For example, `tidyr` functions `gather` and `spread` can be used to turn `wide` data into `long` and vice versa.


## Reminders Before We Proceed

When you apply any function() to an object in R, pay attention to what kind of object that function outputs. Is it a vector? Matrix? List? Other? Since the output of one function is often the input to another, you need to know!

We can access columns of a `data.frame` (or any list) using the `$` operator, as below: 

* `dataset_name$column_name`

* `list_name$list_component`

We can access elements of vectors, matrices, and data frames using `[]` (indices) to indicate locations within the array. Vectors use one index `[i]`. Matrices require a row and column `[i,j]`.


## Some Useful Functions

* `str()`
* `glimpse()` # from dplyr
* `attributes()`
* `names()`
* `class()`
* `dim()`
* `nrow()`
* `ncol()`
* `head()`
* `tail()`
* `summary()`


## A Word on Missing Values

In some datasets, every variable had a value for every case. That is frequently *not* true in real-life data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sum(complete.cases(draft)) # this is two nested functions
sum(!complete.cases(draft)) # what does the ! do?
```

The `which()` function can help identify the locations of missing values when paired with the `is.na()` function. The result is the row numbers of the NA cases. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
index <- which(is.na(draft$draftnumber) == TRUE)
draft[index,]
draft[index, 1:3]
draft[index, "day"]
draft[index, c("month", "day", "draftyear")]
```


## Gather and Spread

Let's `gather` our `draft_wide` dataset into the `long` version.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
draft_wide_gathered <- draft_wide %>% 
  gather(key = "draftyear", value = "draftnumber", num1970:num1973)
```

Let's `spread` our `draft` dataset into the `wide` version.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
draft_spread <- draft %>% 
  spread(key = "draftyear", value = "draftnumber")
```

Both datasets would need some additional processing.

Sometimes we need to `gather` or `spread` a dataset because the observational unit changes. For example, merging two datasets.
