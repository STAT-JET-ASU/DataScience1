## Coming Out of Your Shell

Chapter 10 and Appendix A of **[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)** discusses how to use shell commands to clone, commit, push, etc. These are also covered in the DataCamp course. 

We will discuss how to use the point and click Git interface in R Studio, which can be found in Chapter 13.

You will create a new **project** in R Studio with version control enabled. That is where you will clone your Git repository. You will do any related work in this project. 

You may want to create a subdirectory in your **Home** directory in R Studio for all your version controlled projects. For example, my directory **git_repositories**.

There is a nice discussion about working with R projects **[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)**.


## Commit Name and Email

Okay, this part we need to do in a terminal in RStusio. You may also refer to Chapter 11 of **[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)** or **[GitHub](https://help.github.com/) Help**. 

In RStudio... 

* choose Tools > Terminal > New Terminal

* type the following in the terminal window

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `git config --global user.email "who@where"` [enter]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `git config --global user.name "commitname"` [enter]

These set an **[email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)** and **[name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/)** linked with any commit you make. They do not have to be the same as your primary GitHub email and username. You can change them later.


## Cache Those Credentials

Would you prefer not to type in your username and password for each commit? Me too!

In the terminal, type the following:

`git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'`

Note: Should be a a single line with no space between `--` and `timeout` ! The timeout value is 10 million.

This will store your password for ten million seconds, which is about 16 weeks, enough for a semester.


## Let's Begin!

From the main GitHub page...

* choose the “Start a project” (or green "New") button
* create a new repository named __datascience1repo__
* add a description like "this my practice repository"
* choose "Public" or "Private" (if you have private access)
* choose "Initialize this repository with a README"
* click the green "Create repository" button (_drum roll..._)

Adding a license is optional. If you want one, the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is a good general purpose license.


## Let's Make a Project

In RStudio... 

* choose File > New Project > Version Control > Git

In GitHub... 

* choose the green “Clone or Download” button in your repo

    * select "Use HTTPS"
    * copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard 

Note: You can use SSH authentication if you want to. There's a GitHub page **[here](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/)** that discusses the differences.


## &nbsp;

Now let's head back over to R Studio...

* paste in the repository URL from the the clipboard

* choose your version control subdirectory, if you made one

* create project!

Soon we will create a new file and perform our first `commit` and `push`, but first you need to set the systems to store your login and password so you do not have to enter it for every commit.





## Create, Commit, Push, Pull

I'm just going to talk here for now, so follow along...

* Making changes in R Studio

* Making changes in GitHub

Changes made in R Studio are *pushed* to GitHub. Changes made in GitHub are *pulled* to R Studio. You must *commit* your changes before you push or pull.
