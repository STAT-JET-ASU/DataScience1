```

#### DATA VISUALIZATIONS

Use only the three datasets provided. In some cases, you will have to create new variables or perform your own calculations / transformations. When replicating graphs, you do not have to include the round NOAA and Scripps badges or the March 2018 date stamps.

* Replicate the content of the graph shown on [this page](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/index.html).

* Replicate the content of the graph shown on [this page](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html).

* Replicate the content of the graph shown on [this page](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gr.html).

* Using the monthly data, create side-by-side boxplots of CO2 by decade. Exclude the 1950s (1959 and before) and 2010s (2010 and after) because the data for those decades is incomplete.

* Use the [`multiplot`](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)/) function from the `Rmisc` package to create a display for the 21st century that includes four stacked plots. Exclude the incomplete 2018 data.
    + barplot of mean CO2 for each year with error bars showing uncertainty (using annual data)
    + side-by-side boxplots of CO2 by year (using weekly data)
    + side-by-side boxplots of adjusted CO2 by year (using monthly data)
    + a time series plot showing the change in CO2 for one year, 10 years, and since 1800 (using weekly data)

```{r}
# Put the code for each bullet in a separate code chunk
# Do not suppress your code here when you knit to HTML

```

#### QUESTIONS

1) Discuss briefly how these data were collected.

ANSWER: 

2) What trend(s) or patterns over time do you observe in the CO<sub>2</sub> graphs?

ANSWER: 

3) In what way could these analyses be used to support the theory of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change? Why are data and graphs such as these *evidence* rather than *proof*?

ANSWER:
