### Purpose and Goal

You will create and publish a professional-quality [personal web page using R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.htm) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


### Site Requirements

Your web site should include all of the following.

* Site YAML—controls the web site structure
* INDEX page—the main (home) page for your site
    * A blurb about yourself or a list of interests
    * Contact information (at least an email address)
* RESUME page—brief academic and professional resume 
    * You do _not_ need to include address / phone number
* OTHER page—for example, your research or a list of links (at least 5)
* Use a [theme](http://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) and a [highlight style](https://eranraviv.com/syntax-highlighting-style-in-rmarkdown/) to customize your pages
* A link to the GitHub repository for your web page
* At least one working link to an external site
* An embedded image or video
